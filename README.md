## Motivation
Imagine a world where everyone disposes of their trash responsibly. Here at _Leaf Life Love_, we help people separate their waste with our intelligence!

According to a survey in 2019, only 53% of surveyed citizens in the United States stated that they separated their waste. Based on another survey in 2020, people around the world feel that the lack of programs/services to enable recycling is what stops them from recycling often. The world is in need of a better waste management disposal system. </br>

We are aware of the fact that people are busy. And sometimes, we may feel as if throwing out our trash should be the least of our worries. Or perhaps, we are too afraid to admit that we don't know what to do with the disposal we have in our hands. Should I throw my water bottle in the landfill bin? Or should I recycle this in the compost bin? </br>

**Addressing the E-waste Crisis** <br>
Improper disposal of electronic waste has become a pressing global issue with severe human and environmental consequences. The lack of awareness surrounding responsible e-waste recycling perpetuates the cycle of negligence, leading to the release of hazardous substances into our soil, waterways, and air. It is imperative that we recognize the urgency of proper e-waste disposal, educate ourselves and others, and take collective action to establish accessible recycling programs. By doing so, we can minimize the harmful impact on human health, protect our environment, and pave the way for a sustainable future where technology and responsible waste management coexist harmoniously.

## Solution
Introducing, **Leaf-It**! Our innovative AI-powered trash-can that _can_ handle e-waste recycling along with taking care of landfill, compost, organics, plastic and paper recycling. **Leaf-It!** can efficiently identify the type of trash that is being disposed of, and guide the user to dispose of their trash in the correct bin. </br>

## Design
- The main UI will be hosted by a screen that prompts the user to scan their garbage.
- The basic scanner is located to the left of the screen where users can simply hold the item and the AI will detect (1) the item (2) how to responsible dispose of it.
- There is an e-waste section incorporated into the disposal options.
- Have an accuracy correction feedback system that the user can participate in to make our AI more accurate at identifying the types of garbage (prompt "this is _______ (recycling, landfill etc...) correct? If the garbage type was incorrectly identified, the AI would ask the user to manually enter the type of garbage and collect the responses to refine the model.
- If the user’s garbage is not of an acceptable type, the algorithm generates information on the nearest location that can correctly dispose of that type of garbage (nearest battery disposal center, needles, explosives etc...) upon which the user can scan a barcode to recieve the location imeediately on their devices so they can responsibly dispose of their garbage.

## Feasability and the Future
With our advanced technology and collaboration with OpenAI, we are well-positioned to lead the way in using AI to create a sustainable environment. Partnering sustainability leadership and leveraging government funding, we aim to analyze data, invest in responsible recycling methods, and make AI accessible worldwide. Our ultimate goal is to revolutionize waste management and drive positive change, ensuring a greener future for all.

We imagine a future where people don't just 'leave it' when it comes to trash disposal but instead choose to 'Leaf-It!'—taking an active role in responsible waste management.<br>

We envision our future filled with **Leaf-It!** stations.
